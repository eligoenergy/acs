Note
This project should be considered alpha sofware. While it currently is working for Enova, there
many known issues that are still being addressed and worked on. Those higher up on the totem
pole pushed us to release this now, instead of making it more suitable for public consumption,
because they know we could play that game for awhile. There is a major restructing of access
requests coming right around the corner too.
