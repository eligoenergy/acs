Fix users with no manager create an exception when creating new access request
figure out why tables aren't getting border radius applied
Don't allow acf's for resources with no owners, send email to admin if a request is made
Make sure a manager who is also a resource owner is not able to complete both approval steps
When a manager creates a request for another user, the user needs to be notified of completion
Need to move 'terminate user' to a better spot, right below logout button is not good
Need to refactor manager_approval and resource_owner_approval code
Help desk member should not be able to assign requests to them if the request is to revoke their access
Need to rename the approved_by_manager_at and approved_by_resource_owner at to completed_by_x_at on the permission_requests table so it makes more sense when a request is denied
